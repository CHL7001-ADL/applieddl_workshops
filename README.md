# Installing Anaconda on OSX/Linux/Windows

This tutorial will demonstrate how you can install Anaconda, a powerful package manager, on your Mac.

Anaconda is a package manager, an environment manager, and Python distribution that contains a collection of many open source packages. An installation of Anaconda comes with many packages such as numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, and pandas preinstalled.

1. Go to the [Anaconda Website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#macos) and choose a Python 3.x (recommended version in this course) graphical installer. 
2. Download and start the installation.

# Test your installation
## OSX/Linux

Open a new terminal on your Mac. You can do this by clicking on the Spotlight magnifying glass at the top right of the screen, type “terminal” then click on the terminal icon. Now, type the following command into your terminal:
```python
python --version
```

Another good way to test your installation is to try and open a Jupyter Notebook (a user-friendly notebook, where you can create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text). You can type the command below in your terminal to open a Jupyter Notebook. If the command fails, chances are that Anaconda isn’t in your path. 
```python
jupyter notebook
```

## Windows
Verify the success of your installation by opening Anaconda Prompt, a teminal that is included with Anaconda: from your Windows Start menu, select the shortcut Anaconda Prompt. Type same command as shown in OSX/Linux section.
